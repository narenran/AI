    <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, is the branch of computer science that deals with creating machines and systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, decision making, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. AI has been advancing rapidly in recent years, thanks to the availability of large amounts of data, powerful computing resources, and innovative algorithms. </p>
    <p1>AI can do many things that humans can do, and sometimes even better. For example, AI can:
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description" style="float:right;width:200px;height:200px;">
    </p1>
   <ul><li>
     Recognize faces, objects, emotions, and gestures in images and videos. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand and generate natural language, such as speech, text, and translations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Play games, such as chess, Go, and poker, and beat human champions. 
    </li>
    <li>Create content, such as music, art, poetry, and stories, using generative models.
    </li></ul>
    <p6>AND MANY MORE</p6>
    <p7>AI is a fascinating and complex field that requires constant research and development to achieve its goals and benefits. However, AI also faces many challenges and limitations, such as ethics, security, social, and technical issues. AI is not a magic solution that can solve all problems, but rather a powerful tool that can augment human capabilities and creativity</p7>
